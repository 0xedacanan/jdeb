# Debian packages in java

This library provides an Ant task and a Maven plugin to create Debian packages
from Java builds in a truly cross platform manner. Build your Debian packages
on any platform that has Java support. Windows, Linux - it does not require
additional native tools installed. The API underneath is well abstracted can
easily be adopted for other areas as well.
